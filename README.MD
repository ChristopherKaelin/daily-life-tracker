# The Habit Journal

## Overview
A digital habit/goal tracker and bullet journal that mimics the look, feel, and flow of a paper journal while maintaining accessibility and mobile-first design. The Habit Journal combines productivity tracking with personal reflection in a clean, intuitive web application.

## Description 
The Habit Journal is a responsive web application that combines a habit/goal tracker and bullet journal system into one clean, user-friendly dashboard. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app helps users stay focused, track their progress, and reflect daily‚Äîall in one place. It displays a daily inspirational quote from the ZenQuotes API (with fallback quotes for offline use) and current weather for a user-selected U.S. city, with options to customize quote themes and location preferences. User data is stored locally in the browser using localStorage, ensuring privacy while maintaining progress across sessions. The app prioritizes mobile responsiveness and accessibility to provide a seamless experience across all devices.
